# Mixture Density Network for Inverse Problems

This project implements a Mixture Density Network (MDN) in PyTorch for modeling uncertainty in inverse problems. It outputs a conditional probability distribution instead of a single value.

## ⚙️ Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📚 Usage

```
python src/train_2d.py # change line 23 to get other datasets
python src/train_3d.py
```
